## Features

- Fast and Minimal
- Transparent and independently auditable
- Open source as opposed to competitors

## Installation

As of now, installing BillTracker yourself is generally discouraged. However, **we do encourage** the community to contribute
foundational pieces for that if there is a desire.

## Contributing

As stated above, it is generally discouraged to self-host BillTracker. If you can get it running, more power to you! If
there is a desire in the future from the community to offer a self-hosted version, we're willing to revisit this concept.
We do accept pull requests and issues from the community,
